**1.0.2**

* Worked around the incompatibility with ItemBlacklist. Now both mods can coexist.

**1.0.1**

* [Added incompatibility flag for the ItemBlacklist mod](https://github.com/SChinchi/TricornEliteEquipment/issues/1)
This means this mod will not load if the other is present and an error message to that effect will be printed in the log.

**1.0.0**

* Release
